### Overall Evaluation

**1. Working Environment:**
The environment at FCJ is highly professional and strongly encourages a "Builder" mindset. The workspace is always filled with positive energy, not only comfortable but also inspiring creativity. I particularly appreciate how everyone debates candidly and constructively, not afraid of friction to find the optimal solution. Additionally, interns like myself can sit at the same table and discuss directly with mentors without hierarchical barriers. The open space is a key factor that helps me maintain excitement every day when arriving at the office.

**2. Support from Mentor / Team Admin:**
My mentor acted not just as a technical guide but as a problem-solving mindset coach. Instead of simply giving "right or wrong" answers, he often asked, "Why did you choose this approach?" or "If the user base scales 10x, will this still work?" This coaching method helped me hone my critical thinking and be more meticulous with every line of code. Support from the admin team was very swift, especially in granting access to Cloud resources and paid tools necessary for work.

**3. Relevance of Work to Academic Major:**
Knowledge of Operating Systems, Computer Networks, or Data Structures learned at school provided a good foundation, but applying them to actual work here elevated them to a new level. I was exposed to real-world problems regarding Cloud Computing, Microservices, and DevOps – areas where school often stops at theory. However, this is exactly what I liked most because it forced me to apply foundational knowledge to real production problems, helping bridge the gap between a student and a professional engineer.

**4. Learning & Skill Development Opportunities:**
This internship felt like an intensive career boot camp. Regarding technical skills (Hard skills), I became more proficient in using Git flow, writing Infrastructure as Code (IaC), and debugging distributed systems. As for soft skills, I learned how to work within Agile/Scrum processes, how to write technical documentation that is easy for others to understand, and most importantly, communication skills – knowing how to ask the right questions to the right people at the right time to solve problems fastest.

**5. Company Culture & Team Spirit:**
The company culture values transparency and the spirit of "Knowledge Sharing." When an incident occurs, instead of finding someone to blame, the whole team sits down to conduct a Root Cause Analysis to ensure the error doesn't repeat. Teamwork is also exceptional; I never felt alone when facing difficulties because colleagues were always ready to support, share documentation, or pair-program to help me untangle issues. Tech Talk sessions are great opportunities to bond and learn from each other.

**6. Internship Policies / Benefits:**
Being supported with an AWS account for unrestricted practice (sandbox environment) is a fantastic benefit for technical roles. Additionally, policies supporting international certification exams are a huge motivation for me to strive harder.

### Additional Questions

- **Most satisfying aspect:** I participated in real projects, deployed code to real environments, and saw the actual impact of the features I built.
- **Area for improvement:** The initial technical documentation onboarding process is a bit fragmented, taking quite some time to piece together.
- **Would you recommend it:** Definitely YES. This is an ideal environment for those passionate about Cloud and technology, who want to experience real-world working pressure.

### Suggestions & Expectations

- **Suggestion:** Should organize more cross-team "Code Review" sessions between different intern groups to learn from each other's coding styles and thinking.
- **Future intent:** I strongly hope to have the opportunity to become a full-time employee (Fresher/Junior) to continue contributing to unfinished projects and further develop the skills I have just started to grasp.
- **Other comments:** Thank you to the company for creating a truly high-quality playground for students.
