# Summary Report: “AI-Driven Development Workshop”

### Event Objectives

- Understand the overview of the AI-Driven Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)
- Access and view a real-world demo of Amazon Q Developer
- Deep dive into the Kiro tool and its application in the development process
- Update on the latest developer support tools to increase productivity

### Speakers

- **Toan Huynh** – Speaker on AI-Driven SDLC & Amazon Q
- **My Nguyen** – Speaker on Kiro Demonstration

### Key Highlights

#### AI-Driven Development Life Cycle (SDLC)

- **Shift in Paradigm**: Shifting from traditional development processes to processes with integrated AI support at every stage.
- **Automation**: Automating repetitive tasks in the development lifecycle, from coding to testing and deploying.
- **Efficiency**: Optimizing time and resources thanks to intelligent AI assistants.

#### Amazon Q Developer Demonstration

- **Coding Assistant**: Demo of code suggestions, code logic explanation, and automatic unit test generation.
- **Troubleshooting**: Using Amazon Q to debug and find solutions for technical errors in real-time.
- **Integration**: How to integrate Amazon Q into the development environment (IDE) and daily workflows.

#### Kiro Demonstration

- **Tool Capabilities**: Introduction to the core features of Kiro (related to Kiro IDE/Agent).
- **Practical Use Cases**: Live demo on how to use Kiro to solve specific programming problems.
- **Developer Experience**: Improving the developer experience through Kiro's interface and intelligent features.

### Key Takeaways

#### Tooling Landscape

- **Amazon Q Developer** is not just a chat tool but a comprehensive assistant for the SDLC.
- **Kiro** brings new approaches to supporting the development environment (IDE/Agent).

#### Productivity Focus

- Applying **AI-Driven SDLC** helps minimize manual tasks, allowing developers to focus on complex business logic.
- It is necessary to proactively get used to these tools to avoid falling behind in new technology trends.

### Applying to Work

- **Integrate Amazon Q**: Install and pilot Amazon Q Developer in current projects to support code reviews and test writing.
- **Explore Kiro**: Dedicate time to research Kiro more deeply after the demo to consider its applicability to the team's workflow.
- **Review SDLC Process**: Re-evaluate the team's current development process and identify bottlenecks that can be solved with AI.

### Event Experience

The afternoon workshop focused deeply on **technical demos**, providing an intuitive view of the power of modern programming support tools.

#### Hands-on Insight
- **Toan Huynh's** presentation helped me clearly visualize what an "AI-ized" SDLC process looks like.
- **My Nguyen's** demo on Kiro was very practical, showing the potential of emerging tools alongside giants like AWS.

#### Impact on Workflow
- It became clear that AI is changing the way we write software: faster, more accurate, and with fewer errors.
- The event was concise but substantial, going straight into the combat tools that developers care about.
