# Summary Report: “AWS First Cloud Journey Community Day”

### Event Objectives

-   Foster the AWS community vision and connect industry professionals.
-   Demonstrate practical applications of Generative AI in Enterprise, Banking, and Academic sectors.
-   Explore advanced architectures including RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) and Multi-Agent Systems.
-   Showcase serverless implementations for scalable AI solutions.

### Speakers

-   **Nguyễn Gia Hưng** – Head of Solutions Architect, AWS
-   **Phạm Tiến Thuận Phát, Lê Minh Nghĩa, Trần Đoàn Công Lý** – Enterprise Software
-   **Đinh Lê Hoàng Anh, Nguyễn Tài Minh Huy** – Academic Sector
-   **Kiệt Lâm, Nguyễn Ngọc Quỳnh Mai** – Banking / Internal IT
-   **Lê Phạm Ngọc Uyển, Phan Thị Thanh Thảo, Hồ Điền Đăng Khoa, Nguyễn Quang Nhật Linh** – Banking / Process Automation
-   **Việt Lý** – AWS Partner / Cloud & AI

### Key Highlights

#### 1. Community Vision
-   **Opening Remarks**: Mr. Nguyễn Gia Hưng kicked off the event at Bitexco Tower, outlining the vision for the AWS community and the objectives of sharing practical, hands-on cloud knowledge.

#### 2. Enterprise & Contextual AI
-   **Enterprise Chatbot with MCP**: The team presented on unlocking context using the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** on AWS. They demonstrated how to build chatbots that handle complex enterprise context effectively, sharing lessons learned from actual implementation.

#### 3. Real-World GenAI Applications
-   **Kitchen Recipe Recommendation**: An academic showcase featuring a personalized system powered by GenAI. The session detailed the AWS workflow design used to tailor recipes to user preferences.
-   **Internal Chatbot with RAG**: A deep dive into building an FAQ and knowledge base bot using **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**. The key takeaway was the **fully serverless architecture**, ensuring cost-effectiveness and scalability.

#### 4. Advanced Automation in Banking
-   **Multi-Agent Systems**: A highlight session on applying **GenAI Multi-Agent Systems** to automate complex banking processes. The speakers shared real-world case studies demonstrating how multiple agents coordinate to handle specific banking tasks using serverless workflows.

#### 5. Tools & Orchestration
-   **GenAI with Kiro IDE & Strands Agent**: Explored the application of GenAI in both Production and R&D environments. The session focused on **workflow orchestration** and featured a live multi-agent demo on AWS.

### Key Takeaways

#### Architectural Shift
-   **From Chatbots to Agents**: The industry is moving beyond simple Q&A bots towards **Multi-Agent Systems** that can execute complex tasks and workflows, especially in regulated sectors like Banking.
-   **Serverless is Key**: Both RAG and Agent systems were heavily demonstrated on **Serverless AWS** infrastructure, highlighting it as the standard for modern AI deployment.

#### Practical Implementation
-   **Context is King**: For enterprise adoption, handling context (via MCP or RAG) is crucial for relevance and accuracy.
-   **Orchestration**: Tools like Kiro IDE and Strands Agent are emerging to help manage the complexity of AI workflows.

### Applying to Work

-   **Evaluate Multi-Agent Systems**: Investigate using a multi-agent approach for complex internal automation tasks rather than a single monolithic model.
-   **Adopt Serverless RAG**: Review current internal knowledge bases and prototype a Serverless RAG solution to improve information retrieval.
-   **Explore MCP**: Research the Model Context Protocol to see if it improves context retention in our current chatbot applications.

### Event Experience

The event at Bitexco Tower provided a dense morning of technical insights. The parallel sessions allowed for a deep dive into specific industry verticals.
-   **Networking**: The "Welcome Coffee" and "Buffer" sessions provided excellent opportunities to connect with AWS Solution Architects and industry peers.
-   **Practical Demos**: Seeing live demos of **Multi-Agent systems** in banking and **Recipe Recommendations** bridged the gap between GenAI theory and tangible product delivery.
