# Summary Report: “CloudThinker: Agentic AI & Orchestration on AWS”

### Event Objectives

-   Deep dive into **AWS Bedrock Agent Core** and its capabilities.
-   Explore real-world use cases for building Agentic Workflows.
-   Understand advanced concepts like **Agentic Orchestration** and **Context Optimization** at a technical level (L300).
-   Gain hands-on experience through the CloudThinker Hack workshop.

### Speakers

-   **Mr. Nguyen Gia Hung** – Head of Solutions Architect, AWS
-   **Mr. Kien Nguyen** – Solutions Architect, AWS
-   **Mr. Viet Pham** – Founder & CEO
-   **Mr. Thang Ton** – Co-founder & COO, CloudThinker
-   **Mr. Henry Bui** – Head of Engineering, CloudThinker
-   **Mr. Kha Van** – Workshop Facilitator

### Key Highlights

#### 1. AWS Foundation
-   **Opening**: Mr. Nguyen Gia Hung set the stage for the importance of Agentic AI in the current cloud landscape.
-   **Bedrock Agent Core**: Mr. Kien Nguyen provided a technical overview of AWS Bedrock Agent Core, explaining how it simplifies the creation of agents that can plan and execute tasks by invoking APIs.

#### 2. Practical Application & Use Cases
-   **Building Agentic Workflows**: Mr. Viet Pham demonstrated a concrete use case, showing the end-to-end process of designing and deploying an agentic workflow on AWS.
-   **CloudThinker Introduction**: Mr. Thang Ton introduced the CloudThinker ecosystem and their vision for AI-driven cloud solutions.

#### 3. Deep Dive (Level 300)
-   **Agentic Orchestration & Context Optimization**: This was the technical core of the morning. Mr. Henry Bui discussed advanced strategies for orchestrating multiple agents and optimizing context within Amazon Bedrock to ensure high accuracy and relevance in complex interactions.

#### 4. Hands-on Experience
-   **CloudThinker Hack**: Led by Mr. Kha Van, this 60-minute session allowed attendees to get their hands dirty, applying the morning's concepts to build a prototype agent using the CloudThinker framework and AWS services.

### Key Takeaways

#### Evolution of AI
-   **From Chat to Action**: The industry is shifting from passive chatbots to active Agents that can perform complex orchestration and execute API calls.
-   **Context is Critical**: As workflows get more complex, standard context windows aren't enough. "Context Optimization" strategies are essential to keep costs down and accuracy up.

#### Architecture
-   **Orchestration Patterns**: Managing multiple agents require a robust orchestration layer to decide which agent handles which part of a user request.

### Applying to Work

-   **Prototype an Agent**: Use AWS Bedrock Agent to build a simple internal tool that connects to a company API (e.g., checking leave balance or server status).
-   **Study Context Patterns**: Research the context optimization techniques shared by Henry Bui to apply to our current RAG implementations.
-   **Participate in Hackathons**: Encourage the team to join similar hands-on hacks to stay sharp on the latest AWS features.

### Event Experience

This event was highly technical and focused.
-   **Technical Depth**: The L300 session on Orchestration was particularly valuable for understanding how to scale AI applications beyond simple demos.
-   **Interactive**: The "CloudThinker Hack" provided immediate reinforcement of the theoretical knowledge, making it one of the most effective learning sessions.
