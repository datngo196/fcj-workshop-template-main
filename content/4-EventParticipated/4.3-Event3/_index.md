# Summary Report: “AWS AI/ML & GenAI Workshop”

### Event Objectives

- Provide an overview of the AI/ML landscape and trends in Vietnam
- Guide hands-on practice on Amazon SageMaker for building end-to-end ML models
- Deep dive into Generative AI with Amazon Bedrock (Foundation Models, Agents, Guardrails)
- Equip attendees with Prompt Engineering skills and RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) application building

### Speakers

- **AWS Experts Team**
- _(Specific speaker names were not listed, but the session was led by technical experts)_

### Key Highlights

#### Welcome & Introduction
- **Landscape Overview**: Update on the panorama of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AI/ML) in the Vietnam market.
- **Networking**: Ice-breaker activity to create an open atmosphere for the workshop.

#### AWS AI/ML Services Overview (SageMaker)
- **End-to-end ML Platform**: Understand the workflow on Amazon SageMaker from Data preparation, Labeling, to Training and Tuning models.
- **MLOps Integration**: Integrating Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) to automate deployment.
- **SageMaker Studio Demo**: Experience the interface and features of SageMaker Studio directly through a live walkthrough.

#### Generative AI with Amazon Bedrock
- **Foundation Models Selection**: Comparison and guide on selecting suitable foundation models like Claude, Llama, Titan.
- **Prompt Engineering**: Optimization techniques: Chain-of-Thought, Few-shot learning.
- **RAG Architecture**: "Retrieval-Augmented Generation" architecture and how to integrate Knowledge Bases to increase AI accuracy.
- **Advanced Features**: Using Bedrock Agents for multi-step workflows and Guardrails for content safety.
- **Live Demo**: Building a complete GenAI Chatbot using Amazon Bedrock right in the class.

### Key Takeaways

#### Platform Capabilities
- **SageMaker** is a powerful tool for traditional Machine Learning tasks, standardizing the process from data to model.
- **Bedrock** provides the fastest shortcut to access Generative AI via API without managing complex infrastructure.

#### Strategic Implementation
- **RAG & Agents** are two key technologies that help GenAI applications solve complex business problems rather than just simple chatting.
- **Guardrails** are an indispensable component to ensure AI operates within safety frameworks and complies with corporate regulations.

### Applying to Work

- **Implement MLOps**: Apply standard processes on SageMaker to manage model lifecycles in current projects.
- **Build RAG Systems**: Experiment with integrating internal documents into Bedrock Knowledge Base to create information retrieval assistants.
- **Optimize Prompts**: Apply Chain-of-Thought techniques to improve the response quality of existing chatbots.
- **Model Evaluation**: Use the learned criteria to select the most suitable model (Claude vs Llama) in terms of cost and performance for each use case.

### Event Experience

The workshop was a balanced combination of **traditional Machine Learning** and **modern Generative AI**, providing a solid foundational knowledge.

#### Hands-on & Demo
- The **SageMaker Studio walkthrough** helped me clearly visualize a professional working environment for Data Scientists.
- The **Building a Chatbot with Bedrock** demo was a highlight, proving that creating GenAI applications has become easier and faster than ever.

#### Market Insight
- The introduction to the AI landscape in Vietnam helped me position my business within the general trend and identify potential opportunities.
